## The beauty of programming 



---

### How I got introduced to this beautiful art
##### Before being exposed to the world of software engineering through Stanford's Code in Place, I was slightly cynical about software engineering as a job. I used to think that all code will eventually be fully written by AI and all the hype around building software will evaporate in thin air. But a few lessons and classes later, my perspective has changed.

##### Pretty much everything we do involves one form or other of software. It cannot be escaped, but it can be chosen. Knowing what goes behind to something as simple as a youtube video is amazing. But the involvement of software is embedded in the form of consumption. Software is consumed or it is used to consume. Knowing how to program is the first step of transforming from a consumer to a producer. It's so amusing and amazing. What a time to be alive!

##### Anyways, This was my first blog on Github. I am still new to this site and new to programming itself. When I learn new things of value in programming or any other realm of computer science, I will be writing about it here!
